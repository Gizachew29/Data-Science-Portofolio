## Pose Estimation & Squat Counter

### Introdction 

Pose estimation refers to a general problem in computer vision techniques that detect human figures in images and videos, so that one could determine, for example, where someoneâ€™s elbow shows up in an image. It is important to be aware of the fact that pose estimation merely estimates where key body joints are and does not recognize who is in an image or video. The pose estimation models takes a processed camera image as the input and outputs information about keypoints. The keypoints detected are indexed by a part ID, with a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0. The confidence score indicates the probability that a keypoint exists in that position. An example of this is as shown in the figure below.
