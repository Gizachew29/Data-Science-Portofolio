## [Masters thesis: Respiratory modulation of cardiovascular brain pulsations in Alzheimer’s disease](https://github.com/youssefHosni/Respiratory-modulation-of-cardiovascular-pulsation)

* Utilized statistical methods to find the significant differences in the modulation of brain cardiovascular pulse with respiration between controls and Alzheimer’s cases to help the neurological researchers to have a better understanding of Alzheimer’s diseases. The differences found were strongly significant (P<0.01) and novel.  
* Preprocessed and extracted features using a 3D multiresolution optical flow of 0.25 TB complex brain imaging data using python.
